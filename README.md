# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

Features
User registration and login
CRUD operations for clothing items
Like/dislike functionality for clothing items
Validation and error handling
API routing and centralized error middleware
Deployed backend with persistent database

MongoDB + Mongoose — for data modeling and storage

Celebrate/Joi — for request validation

Helmet — for setting secure HTTP headers

CORS — for handling cross-origin requests

dotenv — for managing environment variables

nodemon — for local development

Custom error handling — using centralized middleware and HTTP status constants

REST API principles — for clean and scalable architecture
